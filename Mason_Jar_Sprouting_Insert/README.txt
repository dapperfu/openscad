# Summary

***6-2-13 - I uploaded the default STL file, in the event that someone doesn't know how to use the Customizer to generate one.***  

A screen to fit inside the ring of a mason jar, such that water can be introduced and drained to coax beans' or seeds' sprouting.  Additionally, air should be able to freely ventilate the jar.  

Do it Yourself â€“ How to Sprout  
1. Soak seeds overnight in a bowl with water.  
2. The next morning, drain water and rinse with   
fresh water once or twice.  
3. Place in a sprouting bag, or sprouting jar   
without any water. (Should still be humid, not   
completely dry.)  
4. Every morning and night rinse with fresh   
water, to keep the sprouts wet and clean of mold.  
5. Ensure the sprouts never dry up, and repeat   
process until your desired length or age of sprout.

# Instructions

By default, this is sized for the noble Mung or Mungo bean.  Bigger or smaller beans might necessitate a different size mesh opening.  Alfalfa seeds would wash right out of this screen.  

You may need to monkey with the width of the screening elements to get them to print well on your printer.  I got good results in ABS with 1.5mm and a 0.40mm nozzle, 0.30mm layer height.  

Please post if you find some other use for this parametric Thing.  

Happy sprouting!
